//global execution:

//1.creation phase : it helps to allocate memory to variable and function are to name of the function, the exact value is 
// not allocated to variables instead.

//2.execution phase : This is phase where the exact values will be allocated to variables, undefined will be removed from row

//3.call stack : In this phase lines that fills from the last to first , then executed in from the last(1st line).
